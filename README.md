# 💱 Currency Converter using Java Swing & JDBC

A desktop GUI application built using Java AWT/Swing for converting currencies between INR, USD, GBP, EUR, JPY, and KRW. 
The project demonstrates early exposure to full-stack logic and practical problem-solving with a real-world use case — currency exchange.

The application is divided into two modules:
- **Currency Converter** – Handles conversion between 6 currencies.
- **JDBC Integration Module** – Connects to a MySQL database to fetch currency info based on country names.

## 📌 Relevance

Though built during my early academic years, this project reflects core software engineering principles that I still rely on as a data scientist:

- 🧠 Logical thinking and algorithm design (conversion logic)
- 🖥️ GUI development and user interaction design
- 🔗 Backend integration via JDBC – a precursor to full-stack systems
- 📊 Domain alignment – working with financial data and currencies

It marks my transition from coding small academic exercises to solving real-world problems using programming — a mindset that continues to guide my ML journey.

## 🧭 Legacy but Foundational

While technologies like Java Swing and JDBC may be considered outdated for modern application development, this project holds continued relevance in my journey as a developer and data scientist.

It taught me:
- How to think in terms of **modular architecture**
- The basics of **user interaction design**
- The importance of **clean data flow** between interfaces and data sources
- How to integrate **front-end logic with back-end systems**, a skill that translates directly to modern frameworks and ML pipelines today

This early exposure laid the groundwork for understanding complex systems — whether it's building a full-stack ML app or deploying models in production.


## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Java (AWT, Swing)
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- MySQL (for country-currency database)


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Import into any Java IDE (NetBeans, IntelliJ, Eclipse)
3. Ensure MySQL is running and update connection strings
4. Run the main class (e.g., `Main.java`)

🗒️ Note: This version uses static currency values. Real-time API support can be added in future.
